# Group Norms

These are the rules and expectations for this group and project.

- Everyone is expected to treat each other with respect.
- No ghosting. If you no longer want to work on the project there will be no hard feelings, but let the team know you are stepping away, so that the project can be adjusted and continued. 
- The group will check in about twice a week, on discord via chat or voice. Each member will determine what they want to accomplish between now and then. 
    - Note: 
        - It is ok to take time off and not assign yourself a new task every single time.
        - It is ok if you are stuck.
        - It is ok to ask for help. 
- While you will need to share some information in order to be able to work on the project, for example:
    - An email address so you can join the Trello board.
    - A GitHub username to join the GitHub org/project.
You don't have to share any personal information. While Discord does offer video chat, you don't have to turn on your video if you don't want to.
